Does anybody know what love is? 
One could say it is the happiness, when two people are together, and share the joy on one's presence. 
But is this enough? Ask a mother and she would say it is the creativity of her child. 
For those who have recently fallen in love it is the bliss of expecting to see the other person. 
What else, but love doesn't bring the regeneration of life?
